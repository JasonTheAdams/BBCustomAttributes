# Beaver Builder Custom Attributes

## What does this do?
It adds the ability to add custom attributes to modules, columns, and rows within Beaver Builder the same way you would add
a class or ID. In fact, you'll find the new field right below those fields in the Advanced tab.

## How do I install it?
1. Download the zip file of this plugin
2. Upload it to your WordPress install
3. Activate the plugin.

## Is this supported?
This is intended to be a very simple and light-weight plugin. Ideally it shouldn't really require much support.
That said, if you create an issue or pull request I'll get to it when I'm able. Please don't expect too much as this
is just a freebie intended to help others.
